1. I have completed all parts of the assignment.
2. No bugs. However, I do have a few compiler warnings about signed vs unsigned comparsions.
3. My program can be run using the makefile - as of now there is no make command for running TestBinomialQueue.  I may add these in.
4. This program uses only input files and has no output files.  Input files are:
   words.txt
   query_words.txt

   5_numbers.txt
   20_numbers.txt
   100_numbers.txt
   1000_numbers.txt
   10000_numbers.txt
