1. I have completed all parts of the program

2. I am having an issue with the last part of the program where the UnionFindStructure thinks there is only one set, but there are still vertices of degree 0. This doesn't happen every time.

3. I have included a make file and compilation can be handled by using make clean &&m make all
   I have included a few runnable options for the make file
   make run0graph1
   make run0graph2
   makerun1
   makerun2
   makerun2five
   makerun2ten

4. The input files are Graph1.txt, Graph2.txt, AdjacencyQueries1.txt, and AdjancencyQueries2.txt
   There are no output files
